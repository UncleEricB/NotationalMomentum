# NotationalMomentum
My take on Notational Velocity

I like the idea of Notational Velocity / nvAlt but I want to use it on any of my machines.  That is,
I don't want my data stored locally.  Lots of fun questions to think about, including but not limited to:

  - Data format for transfer: JSON, AVRO, YAML, ??
  - Getter/Setter server-side: lambda behind ALB sounds interesting
  - Schema / data store for storage and indexing
  - building it all from terraform or CloudFormation
  - lookahead in CLI client
  - ncurses interface in CLI client
  - simple REST API
